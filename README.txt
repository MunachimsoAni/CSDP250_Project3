Project Description: Construct a binary search tree

Input Data: Generates 40 random numbers less than 100

Output result:Traverse the tree with pre/in/post-order respectively, and output the traversal results

Procedures you run the program: In the head file, define class BSTree and struct within the class for the program in private. In the class function file, it declares recursive member functions(traversal, insertion and deletion) and the root node in public. In the main function file, through a loop, 40 random numbers less than 100 are generated with each iteration wrapped with a node, and inserted into the binary tree linked list and then after the loop, the entire binary tree is displayed in the tree traversal orders using a member function
